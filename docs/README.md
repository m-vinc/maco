# maco documentation

maco is a lightweight VMM for macOS. You describe the virtual machines you want
in YAML, and maco reconciles the running system to match: it starts, restarts,
and destroys QEMU virtual machines accelerated by Apple's Hypervisor.framework.

The YAML manifests are the source of truth. A SQLite database caches runtime
state only, so it can always be rebuilt from the manifests. A web UI and an HTTP
API sit on top of the same engine (`pkg/engine`), and everything they can do has
a CLI equivalent.

## Getting started

maco needs QEMU with the Hypervisor.framework entitlement, which Homebrew's
build provides:

```bash
brew install qemu pkg-config libusb
codesign -d --entitlements - "$(which qemu-system-aarch64)" | grep hypervisor
```

Build the binary and boot a VM:

```bash
make build

./maco image pull ubuntu-24.04-arm64
./maco vm new web1 --cpus 2 --memory 2048
./maco vm start web1
./maco vm list
./maco vm stop web1
```

Serve the web UI and HTTP API (start [Redis](building.md#redis-for-background-jobs)
and build with the embedded UI first):

```bash
make build-ui
MACO_REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0 MACO_ADMIN_PASSWORD=changeme ./maco serve --addr :8080
```

On first run maco creates an `admin` account (from `MACO_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, or a
generated password logged once). Manage accounts with `maco user add|list|passwd|rm`,
each with an `admin` or `viewer` role ([authentication.md](authentication.md)).
Log in at https://localhost:8080. The UI has no unix-account dependency; accounts
live in the SQLite database with bcrypt hashes and the browser holds a JWT.

maco runs as root: it manages host networking (native bridges, feth pairs, VLAN
interfaces) and privileged VM networking directly, without shelling out to
`sudo`. QEMU reaches HVF through its own signing entitlement. The data directory
defaults to `~/Library/Application Support/maco` (override with `--data-dir` or
`MACO_DATA_DIR`, which matters under `sudo` since its HOME differs).

## How it fits together

- **Manifests**. One YAML file per VM at `<data-dir>/vms/<uuid>.yml`, the source
  of truth for a VM's spec and desired state. See
  [configuration.md](configuration.md).
- **State cache**. A SQLite database holds runtime state (power state, pid) as a
  cache, always rebuildable from the manifests.
- **Reconcile**. `maco reconcile` boots every VM whose manifest sets
  `autostart` and is not already running, and refreshes the state cache from the
  actual QEMU processes.
- **Surfaces**. The `maco` CLI, the HTTP API, and the web UI are three views of
  the same engine (`pkg/engine`); the API and UI are gated by JWT login.
