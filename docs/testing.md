# Testing

Unit tests live beside the packages they cover, in `pkg/` and `cmd/`. Run
everything with:

```bash
make test
```

That runs `go vet ./...` and `go test ./...`, plus a build check of the native
network helper.

Run with coverage of the library packages:

```bash
go test ./... -coverpkg=./pkg/...
```

## Conventions

The suite is hermetic: no root, and no shared host state. Each test uses a
temporary data directory, and anything that would launch QEMU is exercised at
the argument-construction boundary or gated behind a build tag, so the default
run stays fast and side-effect free.

Representative coverage:

- Manifest save, load, list, resolve round-trips and validation.
- QEMU argument construction, QMP framing, and pid and status handling.
- Stable serial IDs for data disk attachment.
- `pkg/image` rejects an overlay smaller than its base image and accepts a
  sufficiently large one, using sparse QCOW2 fixtures and `qemu-img`.
- Sanitized C framing checks for the native helper: fragmented and coalesced
  stream input, 18-byte BPF capture headers, partial vectored writes, and
  per-frame fallback.

Privileged native networking and live guest boots are validated by hand rather
than in the default run, since they need root and mutate host interfaces.
